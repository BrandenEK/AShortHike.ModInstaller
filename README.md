## Adding your own mod to the installer

## Adding your own skin to the installer
All skins are stored in the [Blasphemous-Custom-Skins](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous-Custom-Skins) repository.  In order to make you own skins available in the installer, clone that repository, add your files that were generated by the [Skin Editor](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous-Skin-Editor), and submit a pull request.
